{"name":"vdbc","tagline":"","body":"### Overview\r\nThis is yet another JDBC database manager. It should be deployable to any modern servlet container. Known to work in Apache Tomcat 7, Glassfish 3.1 and JBoss 7.\r\n\r\n### General Features\r\n * Connect to a database via JDBC\r\n * Connect to JNDI datasources\r\n * Run SQL queries\r\n * Browse database objects\r\n * View database metadata information\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n * Servlet container (Servlet API 3.0+)\r\n * JRE 1.7+\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n[http://dl.bintray.com/ivnpav/generic/141115/vdbc.war WAR] or [http://dl.bintray.com/ivnpav/generic/141115/vdbc-141115-apache-tomcat.zip Apache Tomcat package]\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nQ: _What is the current status of the project?\r\nA: It is work-in-progress. Stable builds will be regularly published. \r\n\r\nQ: _Will you keep developing the project?\r\nA: Hopefully, yes. Anyway, you know what happens to the most of open-source projects: there's always risk of being abandoned.\r\n\r\nQ: _How to run it?\r\nA: Download featured tomcat-vdbc bundle, unzip it and run startup.sh or startup.bat depending on what operating system you use. Also make sure you have set your environment properly:\r\n * variable `JAVA_HOME` must point to a JDK root directory if you have JDK installed\r\n * variable `JRE_HOME` must point to a JRE root directory if you have JRE installed\r\nThen open http://localhost:8080/vdbc/ in your browser.\r\n\r\nQ: _What database management systems are supported?\r\nA: A DBMS is Having trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\nsupported if it provides JDBC-compliant driver. H2 driver is already packaged. Add your driver jars to $TOMCAT_DIR/lib (in case of using featured tomcat package) or wherever your container expect these jars to be.\r\n\r\nQ: _Where are the connection profiles stored?\r\nA: Connection profiles stored in the vdbc-settings.xml file in your home directory (~/.config/vdbc/vdbc-settings.xml). You are encouraged to edit connection profiles using bult-in settings manager.\r\n\r\nQ: _How to disable settings editor?\r\nA: To disable settings editor you should provide a value for system property named \"vdbc.settings.editor-enabled\". E.g., for Tomcat you can add the following text somewhere in the beginning of $TOMCAT_DIR/bin/catalina.sh:\r\n```\r\nCATALINA_OPTS=-Dvdbc.settings.editor-enabled=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ: _Have anybody ever asked you these questions?\r\nA: Actually, no, but it's nice to have a FAQ section.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
